I've been using LLMs to synoptically synthesise the ideas that I find myself thinking about, often in the form of poems. Some of these poems have become integral to my thinking. I decided that these poems ought to be shared, and therefore I created this repository. So this repository servers both as an avenue for sharing those poems and a central location where they are collected.
